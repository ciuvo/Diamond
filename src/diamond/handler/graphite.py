"""
Send metrics to a [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) using the default interface.

Graphite is an enterprise-scale monitoring tool that runs well on cheap hardware.
It was originally designed and written by Chris Davis at Orbitz in 2006 as side
project that ultimately grew to be a foundational monitoring tool. In 2008, Orbitz
allowed Graphite to be released under the open source Apache 2.0 license. Since
then Chris has continued to work on Graphite and has deployed it at other companies
including Sears, where it serves as a pillar of the e-commerce monitoring system.
Today many [large companies](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/who-is-using.html)
use it.
